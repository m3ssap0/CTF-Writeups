# b01lers CTF 2020 – Life on Mars

* **Category:** web
* **Points:** 100

## Challenge

> We earth men have a talent for ruining big, beautiful things.

## Solution

The left menu of the webpage is made up of items calling `get_life()` JavaScript method contained into `http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/static/js/life_on_mars.js` file.

```javascript
function get_life(query) {
  //jquery ajax for querying server
  /*
  response = $.load('/query?search=' + query, function(responseTxt, statusTxt, xhr).parseJSON(response);
    {
    if (statusTxt == "success") {

    }
  });

*/
  //alert(query);
  $.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "/query?search=" + query,
    data: "{}",
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    dataType: "json",
    cache: false,
    success: function(data) {
      var table_html =
        '<table id="results"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>';
      $.each(data, function(i, item) {
        table_html +=
          "<tr><td>" + data[i][0] + "</td><td>" + data[i][1] + "</td></tr>";
      });
      table_html += "</table>";

      $("#results").replaceWith(table_html);
    },

    error: function(msg) {
      //alert(msg.responseText);
    }
  });
}
```

This method receives a string in input and uses it to contact a remote service, i.e. `http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/query?search=<param>` endpoint, where requests are done to retrieve data.

The remote service is vulnerable to SQL injection.
